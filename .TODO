### Idea:
[Do 2nd, second and do 1st first]
So a little above in the right corner of all msgs, there will be a 
little arrow going down, when you press it, it will show the following options => Reply, and React:

2nd
Reply == the next msg I send will have a little box above it, with 
the msg from the other person. (e.g. B send a msg saying "Hi how are you? C send a msg using the reply feature saying "I'm good thanks". C can't reply to him self.). The little box will appeaer above the msg person e.g. C send with the and inside the box will have the msg that e.g. person B send. [You can reply to your self]

1st
React == When you click react, a list with most used emojis (Heart, Like, Happy face, and Laugh. ❤️👍😁🤣😂). and then after all of those emojis a + sing will be on it's right side, when you click you get acess to all the emojis. When you  click in any of the emojis the emoji will appear below the msg that you reacted,
