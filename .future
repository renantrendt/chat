IDEASSSSSSS:

- custom animations to name
- send images
- last visited == last time you 'entered' the  specific room

- ok next thing -> image sending, so there's kidna like 2 things
1. When a user is in a room, and he drags from like out side the website an image, 
the image will appear in the "type a msg" space, then a [ENTER](ENTER LIKE A SPACE) 
below the image will be the place that you are able to put the text like both  of them 
together.
2. add a (screenshot for the image) that when clicked it open the finder app or someth
ing idk how does it work, for the user to slect an image from this persons files(??)
