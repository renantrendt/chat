Phase 1: Message Reaction System

## Overview
Create a message reaction system that allows users to react to messages with emojis.

## User Flow
1. **Down Arrow Access**: Each message displays a down arrow that users can click. The arrow is fixed so it is always there 
2. **React Button**: Clicking the down arrow opens a small popup with a "React" button
3. **Emoji Selector**: pre-selected emojis: "😅❤️🤣👍😂☠️", when clicked appear below the msg reacted with a blue bg
4. **Additional Emojis**: A "+" button on the right side of the emoji picker opens a full emoji picker for more options (use emoji or unicode2 lybris)
5. **Reaction Display**: Selected emojis appear horizontally below the message they were reacted to

## Reaction Rules
- **One Reaction Per User Per Message**: Each user can only have ONE active reaction per message
- **Reaction Replacement**: If a user picks a new emoji (e.g., changes from ☠️ to 😁), it replaces their previous reaction
- **Multiple Users Same Emoji**: When multiple users react with the same emoji, show count (e.g., "☠️3" for 3 users)
- **Remove Own Reactions**: Users can click their own existing reaction emoji to remove it
- **Reaction Persistence**: Reactions are stored and persist across sessions

## Technical Notes
- Reactions table already exists in database
- Popup positioning: Emoji picker appears above/below the "React" button
- Display format: Reactions shown in horizontal row below each message

## Example
User B says: "How are you?"
User A reacts with 👍
Result: 👍 appears below the message

If User C also reacts with 👍:
Result: 👍2 appears below the message
