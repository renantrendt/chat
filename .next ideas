## For now ->
Adding a Profile page, at the home screen, it will be in the
right top of the scren. It will have a "Image" that the user
will be able to drop his image/picture, it will be in a ciruclar 
moldure, the moldure will appear above the persons name in the 
rooms.
And also in the profile page, some colors so that you can choose to 
put as your color of the name 




## For later ->
Add in the left side of room (in the side where the "Save Chat" is), a 
UI with every one that already entered this specific room, and a "Online" if
the person is online, and the color is green, and if a "Off" if the person
is offline. I Suppose it is not so hard. The sidebar should NOT be overlaping
the chat part of the screen DO NOT CHANGE THE SIZES OF ANYTHING ONLY THE
SIDE BAR OF THE ONLINE/OFFLINE!  anyone who have left the room still will
have their name in the side bar, but with a offline red text instead of 
online green, only if someone has left within a 45minutes gap and not came
back then the name goes away
