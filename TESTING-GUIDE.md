# Testing Guide - Double Check Mark Feature

## Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The double check mark feature is now implemented. Here's how to test it:

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Setup
- Open the app in two different browsers (or one regular + one incognito window)
- Create a username for each window (e.g., "Alice" and "Bob")

### 2. Test Message Status
1. **Alice creates a room** and gets a room code
2. **Bob joins the room** using the code
3. **Alice sends a message**
   - You should see a single gray check âœ“ (sent)
   - When Bob is in the room, it should change to double gray checks âœ“âœ“ (delivered)
   - When Bob scrolls to see the message, it should turn to blue double checks âœ“âœ“ (read)

### 3. Test Offline Behavior
1. **Bob leaves the room** (goes back to home screen)
2. **Alice sends another message**
   - Should show only single check âœ“ (sent)
3. **Bob rejoins the room**
   - Alice's message should update to double gray checks âœ“âœ“ (delivered)
   - When Bob scrolls to see it, should turn blue âœ“âœ“ (read)

## What's Working

âœ… Single check mark when message is sent
âœ… Double gray check marks when recipient is online
âœ… Blue double check marks when message is read
âœ… Real-time status updates
âœ… User activity tracking (30-second heartbeat)
âœ… Visibility detection (marks as read when scrolled into view)

## Troubleshooting

If check marks aren't showing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure you ran all the SQL in Supabase
3. Refresh both browser windows
4. Check that Supabase realtime is enabled for the messages table

## Note on Cleanup Job

The automatic cleanup job (to mark users as inactive) requires pg_cron which may not be available on your Supabase plan. Without it, users might appear online longer than expected, but the feature will still work - just with a slight delay in status updates.
